# Playlist-Renamer
This program reads the *.wpl music playlist file and renames the actual audio file names according to order in which they appear in the playlist.

Note:	The executable program should be placed in the same folder with audio files as well as playlist file. The playlist should be named "playlist" and have wpl estension.

You can find the source file in "Playlist Renamer" folder. Also the compiled program with sample music files and a sample playlist is under "Release" folder.

Feel free to use this program.
If you are thinking to use it for commercial purposes, don't forget to mention me as an author of it.
